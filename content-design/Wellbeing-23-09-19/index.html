            <h2>2. Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Well-being disparities</h3>
            <h4>Disabled people report lower well-being levels than non-disabled people</h4>
            <p>The average (mean) ratings across the four measures of personal well-being in the year 2018 were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>6.5 out of 10 for disabled people, compared to 7.4 for non-disabled people, for happiness yesterday</li>
              <li>6.9 out of 10 for disabled people, compared to 7.7 for non-disabled people, for feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile</li>
              <li>6.6 out of 10 for disabled people, compared to 7.6 for non-disabled people, for life satisfaction</li>
              <li>3.6 out of 10 for disabled people, compared to 2.4 for non-disabled people, for anxiety yesterday (higher numbers equate to poorer well-being in this measure)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Between the years 2014 and 2018, all four well-being measures remained stable for both disabled and non-disabled people.</p>

            <h3>Loneliness disparities</h3>
            <p><strong>A higher percentage of disabled people feel lonely compared to non-disabled people</strong></p>
            <p>The proportion of disabled people who feel lonely regularly is more than two times that of non-disabled people. In the year ending March 2018, 34.6% of disabled people reported that they felt lonely regularly, this compares to only 16.0% for non-disabled people.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Between the years 2013 to 2014 and 2017 to 2018, the proportion of disabled people who reported feeling lonely regularly increased by 3.0 percentage points, despite the figure for non-disabled people falling by 0.5 percentage points.&nbsp;</p>

          <!-- Section 4 -  data -->
          <div id="data" class="content-margin">
            <h2>3. Well-being data</h2>

            <h3>Impairment type breakdowns</h3>
            <p><strong>Well-being levels are lowest in disabled people whose main health problem is a mental condition</strong></p>
            <img src="charts/1a.png">
            <img src="charts/1b.png">
            <p>The average well-being levels of disabled people varies with impairment type. Whilst the average rating for each well-being measure was poorer for disabled people in all impairment types (physical, mental or “other”), well-being measures were notably poor for those with a mental condition as their main health problem.</p>

            <h3>Impairment severity breakdowns</h3>
            <p><strong>Lower well-being levels are seen in disabled people with more severe impairments</strong></p>
            <img src="charts/fig2.png">
            <p>Disabled people with a condition that impairs their ability to complete daily activities “a lot” have poorer well-being ratings in all four measures, than those whose condition impairs this ability “a little”.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This effect is also seen in loneliness, where a much higher proportion of people with severe impairments feel lonely regularly, compared to those with less severe impairments. 44.4% of those who are impaired “a lot” feel lonely regularly, compared to 30.2% of those impaired “a little” and 16.0% of those without a disability.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Breakdowns by impairment type and severity</h3>
            <p><strong>The lowest well-being levels are seen in disabled people with a severe impairment and a mental condition as a main health problem</strong></p>
            <img src="charts/fig3.png">
            <p>Those with all impairment types (physical, mental or other) have poorer well-being ratings when their impairment is more severe.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Disabled people whose primary health problem is a mental condition and whose ability to carry out day-to-day activities is impaired “a lot” by their condition, have the lowest well-being scores on all measures. The greatest disparity is seen in anxiety ratings, where those who are severely impaired and whose main health problem is a mental condition have an average rating of 5.7, compared to 2.4 for non-disabled people.</p>

            <h3>Age breakdowns</h3>
            <p><strong>The largest disparity in the proportion of people who feel lonely regularly, between disabled and non-disabled people, is seen in those aged 16-24</strong></p>
            <img src="charts/fig4.png">
            <p>Loneliness is highest in the younger age groups (as previous research has shown) for both disabled and non-disabled people; 61.4% of disabled 16-24 year olds feel lonely regularly, compared to 24.8% of non-disabled people in the same age group.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The percentage of people who feel lonely regularly then decreases with age for both disabled and non-disabled people, with the lowest proportion of people who feel lonely in the 65+ age groups. The disparity between disabled and non-disabled people in the proportion of people who feel lonely regularly also decreases with age, from 36.6 percentage points in the 16-24 age group to 12.7 percentage points in the 65+ age group.</p>
            <p>Disparities in the average ratings on the four well-being measures, between disabled and non-disabled people, are relatively consistent across all age groups.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Gender breakdowns</h3>
            <p><strong>There are no major differences between men and women in the disparities for well-being ratings of disabled and non-disabled people</strong></p>
            <p>Despite a general trend of higher happiness, worthwhile and life satisfaction ratings in women for both disabled and non-disabled people, the disparities between disabled and non-disabled people are consistent for men and women in these measures.</p>
            <p>The trend is reversed when looking at anxiety and loneliness, with higher anxiety ratings and proportions of people who feel lonely regularly seen in both disabled and non-disabled women in comparison to male counterparts. However, the disparities between disabled and non-disabled people are also consistent for men and women in these areas.</p>

            <h3>Breakdowns by country</h3>
            <p><strong>There is a bigger disparity in the average anxiety ratings for disabled and non-disabled people in Scotland than that in England</strong></p>
            <p>Disparities in the average happiness, worthwhile and life satisfaction ratings for disabled and non-disabled people are relatively consistent across the four UK countries.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>However, there appears to be differences between the four countries in the disparities for the average anxiety ratings of disabled and non-disabled people. Disabled people in Scotland average 1.6 less on anxiety ratings than non-disabled people, this compares to a disparity of 1.1 in England. The disparity in average anxiety ratings are 1.3 in Wales and 1.4 in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Annual Population Survey is a household survey of approximately 250,000 individuals, covering UK. The survey does not cover student accommodation. Analysis using the APS in this bulletin looks at the working age population only (16-64 year olds). Data is collected between January and December of each year.</p>
            <p>The Community Life Survey is a household self-completion survey of approximately 10,000 adults aged 16+ in England. The survey can be completed either in a paper or online format; the question regarding disability status is asked online only. Data for the 2017 to 2018 year was collected between August 2017 and March 2018.</p>
