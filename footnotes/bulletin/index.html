        <!-- Main content -->
        <article class="col col--md-36 col--lg-39">
          <h2>1. Main points</h2>
          <p>Overall levels of crime showed falls in recent decades, but levels have remained broadly stable in recent years. While in the last year there has been no change in overall levels of crime, this hides variation seen in individual crime types. The latest figures show a mixed picture, with continued rises in some types of theft and fraud and falls in computer misuse. Consistent with the rising trend over recent years, there were increases in some of the less frequently occurring but higher-harm types of violence, including offences involving knives and sharp instruments.</p>

          <h3>Headline figures</h3>
          <p>Over recent quarters, estimates from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) have indicated rises in theft. While the latest estimate showed no significant change in the last year, theft showed a 13% increase compared with the year ending March 2017. Despite this increase, estimates of theft remain much lower than 20 years ago.</p>
          <p>Police recorded crime figures give a reliable indication of trends in some types of offence involving theft that are thought to be well-reported and accurately recorded by the police. In the latest year these data show:<p>
            <ul>
              <li>a 2% increase in vehicle offences, which includes an 8% increase in the subcategory of “theft or unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle”</li>
              <li>an 11% increase in robbery</li>
              <li>a 3% decrease in burglaries, following rises seen in the previous two years</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The CSEW shows that the level of lower-harm violent offences (for example, violence without injury and assault with minor injury) did not change. However, police recorded crime gives more insight into the lower-volume but higher-harm violence that the survey either does not cover or does not capture well. These data show:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a 4% decrease in the number of homicides<sup> <a id ="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> following a period of increases over the last four years</li>
            <li>an 8% increase in the number of police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments<sup> <a id ="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></li>
            <li>a 3% increase in the number of police recorded offences involving firearms</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Many of these lower-volume, higher-harm types of violence tend to be concentrated in metropolitan police force areas such as London, the West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester.</p>
          <p>The other changes seen in the main crime types measured by the CSEW were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a 17% increase in fraud offences</li>
            <li>a 21% decrease in computer misuse</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Latest figures</h2>
          <p>A summary of the latest figures for a selection of crime types is given in Table 1, using the most appropriate data source for each. More detailed analysis by crime type is provided in Sections 6 to 11.</p>

          <h2>3. Statistician's comment</h2>
          <p>Commenting on today’s figures, Mark Bangs from the Office for National Statistics Centre for Crime and Justice said:</p>

          <p>“The picture of crime is a complex one. Overall levels of crime have remained steady, but this is not the case for all types of crime. For example, overall levels of violence have remained steady but we have seen increases in violent crimes involving knives and sharp instruments. We have seen increases in fraud and overall theft, but decreases in burglary following recent rises.”</p>


          <h2>4. Things you need to know about this release</h2>

          <h3>How do we measure crime?</h3>
          <p>Crime covers a wide range of offences, from the most harmful such as murder and rape through to more minor incidents of criminal damage or petty theft. In general, the most serious crimes tend to be relatively low in volume and trends in total crime are often mainly influenced by changes in the levels of higher volume but less harmful crimes. Crime is often hidden and different types of offence occur in different circumstances and at different frequencies. This means crime can never be measured entirely by any single source.</p>

          <h3>Data sources included</h3>
          <p>This bulletin reports on two main sources of crime data: the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and police recorded crime. Where possible, we refer to other sources of data to support our findings.</p>

          <p>The CSEW is a face-to-face victimisation survey. People resident in households in England and Wales are asked about their experiences of a selected range of offences in the 12 months prior to the interview.</p>

          <p>Police recorded crime is the number of notifiable <sup><a id ="fnref:3" href="#fn:3" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> crimes reported to and recorded by the 44 police forces in England and Wales. For some types of crime, due to ongoing changes in police recording practices, an increase in the number of offences recorded by the police is unlikely to indicate a real rise in these types of crime.</p>

          <p>For an overview of general data quality and specific quality issues to be aware of for this release, see the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019#quality-and-methodology">Quality and methodology section</a>.</p>

          <p>Detailed information on the CSEW can be found in Section 2 of the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales">User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales</a>. Detailed information on police recorded crime can be found in Section 3.</p>

          <h4>Time periods covered</h4>
          <p>The latest CSEW figures presented in this release are based on interviews conducted between April 2018 and March 2019, measuring peoples’ experiences of crime in the 12 months before the interview.</p>

          <p>The latest recorded crime figures relate to crimes recorded by the police during the year ending March 2019 (April 2018 to March 2019). A “snapshot” of police recorded crime data for the year ending March 2019 was taken on 7 June 2019 to ensure the data do not change during the analysis period <sup><a id ="fnref:4" href="#fn:4" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>.</p>

          <h3>Other crime statistics and the wider criminal justice system</h3>
          <p>In this bulletin we present the latest crime figures and trends. It provides a general overview, with more detailed discussion for certain types of crime where findings need a fuller explanation. If you are looking for a more in-depth analysis of specific types of offences, you may be interested in other articles and research that we produce throughout the year. To access these articles, see our <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice">main crime and justice webpage</a>.</p><p>The crime statistics reported in this release relate to only a part of the wider set of official statistics available on crime and other areas of the criminal justice system. This wider context includes statistics on: the outcomes of police investigations; the judicial process including charges, prosecutions and convictions; through to the management of prisons and prisoners.</p><p>Some of these statistics are published by the Home Office or the Ministry of Justice. We have produced a flowchart showing the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/overviewofcrimeandjusticestatistics">connections between the different aspects of crime and justice</a>, as well as the statistics available for each area.</p>

          <h2>5. Overview of crime</h2>
          <p>This section provides an overview of findings across our two main data sources. Some of these findings are discussed in more detail in later sections.</p><p>The latest estimates from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) for the year ending March 2019 show that there was no change in all CSEW crime (including fraud and computer misuse) compared with the previous year (11.2 million offences, Figure 1). Despite some apparent fluctuation over the last two years, there have been no statistically significant changes in all CSEW crime during this period. The trend has therefore been flat. It is important to look at individual crime types as the relatively stable overall picture hides variation both within and across crime types.</p>

          <h3>The CSEW shows changes in theft, computer misuse, fraud and criminal damage to a vehicle</h3>
          <p>When looking at the main types of crime, the CSEW shows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>while the latest estimate of 3,750,000 theft offences showed no significant change in the last year, there was a 13% increase compared with the year ending March 2017</p></li>
            <li><p>computer misuse offences decreased by 261,000 offences (21%, to 966,000 offences), due largely to a 38% decrease in computer viruses</p></li>
            <li><p>fraud offences increased by 554,000 offences (17%, to 3.8 million offences); this was driven mainly by an increase in the “bank and credit account fraud” offence category, which saw a volume increase of 338,000 offences (15%, to 2.6 million offences) </p></li>
            <li><p>the overall volume of criminal damage has not changed (1.1 million offences), however, criminal damage to a vehicle increased by 121,000 offences (17% to 814,000 offences)</p></li>
            <li><p>all other main types of crime measured by the survey showed no statistically significant change in the number of offences (see <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables">Appendix Table A1</a> for details)</p></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Most people are not victims of crime</h3>
          <p>The latest survey estimates show that 8 in 10 adults did not experience any of the crimes asked about in the survey in the previous 12 months <sup><a id ="fnref:5" href="#fn:5" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>. This figure has remained stable since the introduction of fraud and computer misuse offences into the CSEW. It is much more likely for an adult in England and Wales to experience fraud, than a violent offence (Figure 2). However, likelihood of victimisation varies by personal and household characteristics (for more information, see the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/focusonpropertycrimeappendixtables">Property crime tables</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/thenatureofviolentcrimeappendixtables">Nature of violent crime: appendix tables</a>)</p><p>

          <h3>Police recorded crime data show a continued, but smaller, rise in offences involving knives or sharp instruments</h3>
          <p>Over the last year, police figures indicated rises in some higher-harm violent offences involving the use of weapons <sup><a id ="fnref:6" href="#fn:6" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup>. Recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments increased by 8% to 43,516 offences <sup><a id ="fnref:7" href="#fn:7" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup>. This latest rise is smaller than that seen a year ago (up 19% in the year ending March 2018). However, the latest 8% rise is slightly higher than the 6% year-on-year rise reported last quarter.</p>
          <p>As well as the increase in offences involving knives or sharp instruments, offences involving firearms recorded by the police rose by 3% (to 6,684 offences). These offences have seen rises over the last five years but the rate of increase was slower over the last two years (Figure 3). </p>
          <p>Figures reported in the year ending December 2018 bulletin showed a small fall (2%) in the number of offences involving firearms but this has not continued in the latest data.</p>
          <p>We are aware of improvements in recording practices by police to better identify the involvement of a firearm, which will have contributed to this latest rise. However, the scale of the effect is unclear. These improvements have impacted on offences identified as involving "other firearms", which include weapons such as stun guns, CS gas and pepper spray.</p>

          <p>Further discussion about offences involving knives or sharp instruments can be found in <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019#rise-in-offences-involving-knives-or-sharp-instruments-and-firearms-offences">Rises in offences involving knives or sharp instruments and firearms offences</a>.</p>

          <h3>Decrease in the number of homicides following rises over recent years</h3>
          <p>The total number of homicides recorded by the police fell by 4% in the last year (from 728 to 701 offences) <sup><a id ="fnref:8" href="#fn:8" aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup>. This fall comes after four consecutive annual increases in homicides since the year ending March 2014 (Figure 4).</p><

          <h3>Rises in vehicle-related theft continue, but at a slowing rate</h3>
          <p>Police recorded crime figures showed a 2% increase in vehicle offences in the year ending March 2019 (to 468,315 offences). These offences have been increasing in each of the last four years but the latest annual increase is smaller than previously seen (the increase in the year ending March 2018 was 12%; Figure 5).</p><p>The increase in vehicle offences in the latest year is due largely to an 8% increase in the subcategory “theft or unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle” (to 114,656 offences). However, this is the smallest increase seen in recent years and compares with a 20% rise in the year ending March 2017 and a 16% rise in the year ending March 2018. The subcategory “theft from a vehicle”, which accounts for more than half of vehicle offences, showed a 1% increase compared with the previous year, while “aggravated vehicle-taking” decreased by 6% following little change since the year ending March 2016 (see <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables">Appendix Table A4</a>).</p><p>We believe the recent increases in police recorded vehicle offences reflect genuine rises as these offences are thought to be generally well-reported by victims and well-recorded by the police. This is supported by trend data from the CSEW. While the latest estimate from the crime survey showed no change in the last year, vehicle-related theft showed a 14% increase when compared with the year ending March 2017. This is similar to the increase of 15% in police recorded vehicle offences over the same two-year period.</p>

          <h3>Robbery showed an increase</h3>
          <p>The police recorded an 11% rise in robbery (to 85,736 offences; Figure 6). The number of recorded robberies is disproportionately high in London, accounting for 40% of all recorded robberies. In comparison, London accounts for 16% of all recorded crimes in England and Wales <sup><a id ="fnref:9" href="#fn:9" aria-describedby="footnote-label">9</a></sup>.</p>
          <p>The rise seen in robbery is likely to reflect a real increase in these crimes. While it is likely robbery is impacted by some recording effects, this is thought to be less pronounced than for other crime types (see <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019#whats-happened-to-the-volume-of-crime-recorded-by-the-police">What’s happened to the volume of crime recorded by the police?</a>).</p><p>While the CSEW does show indications of a rise in robbery over the last two years, there was no change in the latest year. However, the CSEW does not provide a robust measure of short-term trends in robbery due to it being a relatively low-volume crime.</p>

          <p>More detailed analysis by crime type is provided in Sections 6 to 11 of this bulletin and further breakdowns are provided in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables">Appendix tables</a> published alongside this bulletin.</p>

          <h3>CSEW and police recorded crime figures for main crime types</h3>
          <p>Over recent years, most crime types have been affected by improved police recording and changes in police priorities. This effect is particularly pronounced for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>violent crime, particularly violence without injury offences</p></li>
            <li><p>sexual offences</p></li>
            <li><p>stalking and harassment</p></li>
            <li><p>public order offences </p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>It is thought that increases in these crime types largely reflect changes in reporting and recording practices. These are discussed in more detail in <a href="https://publishing.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019#whats-happened-to-the-volume-of-crime-recorded-by-the-police">What’s happened to the volume of crime recorded by the police?</a>.

          <h2>6. No change in the most common types of violent crime, but a fall in homicides</h2>
          <p>This section examines the most recent findings on violent crime and includes:</p>

          <ul>
          <li><p>the more frequently-occurring types of violent crime measured by the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), such as assault</p></li>
          <li><p>some of the relatively low-volume types of violent crime recorded by the police, such as homicide, and death or serious injury caused by unlawful driving</p></li>
          </ul><p>Violent crime is a broad term that covers a wide variety of offences, including: minor assaults such as pushing and shoving, harassment and psychological abuse (that result in no physical harm) and attempted offences, through to wounding, physical assault and murder.</p>

          <p>The CSEW data include incidents of physical violence with and without injury. Violent offences in police recorded data are referred to as “violence against the person” <sup><a id ="fnref:10" href="#fn:10" aria-describedby="footnote-label">10</a></sup> and include: </p>

          <ul>
          <li><p>homicide</p></li>
          <li><p>death or serious injury caused by unlawful driving</p></li>
          <li><p>violence with injury</p></li>
          <li><p>violence without injury</p></li>
          <li><p>stalking and harassment</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>While the CSEW provides a good picture of the overall trend in violent crime, police recorded crime is a better measure of higher-harm but less common types of violence.</p>

          <p>The latest trends in violent crime varied across different types of violence. The CSEW showed no change in the overall level of violence in recent years. However, there were rises seen in the higher-harm but less common types of violence recorded by the police, including offences involving knives or sharp instruments. These rises are consistent with trends seen over recent years. However, rises in homicide seen over the same period have not continued in the latest data. Crimes involving weapons are discussed in <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019#whats-happened-to-the-volume-of-crime-recorded-by-the-police">Rises in offences involving knives or sharp instruments and firearms offences</a>. </p>

          <h3>CSEW shows no change in the level of violence in recent years</h3><p>For the offences and population that it covers, the CSEW provides the best measure of trends for overall violent crime. It has used a consistent methodology across the time series back to 1981. The survey covers crimes that are not reported to or recorded by the police and so tends to provide the better measure of more common but less harmful crimes. Unlike police recorded crime statistics, the CSEW is also not affected by changes in recording practices and police activity.</p><p>Factors influencing changes in police recorded crime are described in more detail in <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019#whats-happened-to-the-volume-of-crime-recorded-by-the-police">What’s happened to the volume of crime recorded by the police?</a></p><p>There were an estimated 1.3 million incidents of violence experienced by adults aged 16 years and over in the latest CSEW survey for the year ending March 2019. This figure has not changed significantly compared with last year. This continues the relatively stable trend seen over the last five years, following long-term decreases since the peak in 1995 (Figure 7). </p>

          <h3>Long-term reductions in violent crime supported by other data</h3>
          <p>The longer-term reductions in violent crime, as shown by the CSEW, are reflected in research conducted by the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/1477055/Trends-in-violence-in-England-and-Wales_-NVSN-REPORT-2019.pdf">Violence Research Group at Cardiff University (PDF, 653KB)</a> <sup><a id ="fnref:11" href="#fn:11" aria-describedby="footnote-label">11</a></sup>. Their annual survey covers a sample of hospital emergency departments, minor injury units and walk-in centres in England and Wales. Results showed that the number of violence-related attendances in 2018 was 41% lower than in 2010.</p><p>In addition, findings from the most recent <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity/2017-18">admissions data for NHS hospitals</a> in England showed that assault admissions for the year ending March 2018 were 33% lower than the year ending March 2008 (42,181 admissions). This is despite a recent increase of 7% in assault admissions for the year ending March 2018 <sup><a id ="fnref:12" href="#fn:12" aria-describedby="footnote-label">12</a></sup> compared with the year ending March 2017 (a volume increase of 1,729 to 28,179 admissions). This increase was driven largely by admissions for assault by a sharp object and assault by bodily force. </p>

          <h3>Homicides have decreased, following four consecutive years of increases</h3><p>The police recorded 701 homicides <sup><a id ="fnref:13" href="#fn:13" aria-describedby="footnote-label">13</a></sup> in the year ending March 2019, a 4% fall (from 728) compared with the previous year <sup><a id ="fnref:14" href="#fn:14" aria-describedby="footnote-label">14</a></sup> (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables">Table A4</a>). In part, this fall results from terrorist incidents having occurred in the previous year. It also reflects a decrease recorded by the Metropolitan Police in the latest year following a notably high number recorded in the previous year. The picture across other police forces was mixed.</p>

          <p>This is the first fall in the number of homicides since the year ending March 2014, following four consecutive year-on-year increases. The rate of homicide in the population remains very low, at 12 homicides per 1 million people.</p>

          <p>The number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased by 9% in the last year (to 260 offences <sup><a id ="fnref:15" href="#fn:15" aria-describedby="footnote-label">15</a></sup>). Of all recorded homicides in the latest data, 39% involved a knife or sharp instrument <sup><a id ="fnref:16" href="#fn:16" aria-describedby="footnote-label">16</a></sup> (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/policeforceareadatatables">Table P4</a>), the same proportion as the previous year. The recent reduction in such offences was driven by falls seen in London. The Metropolitan Police recorded a 39% reduction to 67 homicides involving a knife or sharp instrument in the year ending March 2019. This latest figure was down from 110 recorded in the previous year but remains higher than 56 recorded in the year ending March 2017. </p>

          <p>For more information on selected violent and sexual crimes involving a knife or sharp instrument, see Table 4 in <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019#rise-in-offences-involving-knives-or-sharp-instruments-and-firearms-offences">Rises in offences involving knives or sharp instruments and firearms</a>.</p>

          <p>There was also a 23% decrease in attempted murder offences in the latest year (to 1,033 offences). Much of this fall is because of the large number of attempted murder offences recorded in the previous year from the Manchester (235 offences) and London terrorist attacks (59 offences).</p>

          <h3>Little change in death or serious injury caused by unlawful driving in the latest year</h3>
          <p>Offences recorded by the police related to death or serious injury caused by unlawful driving have showed little change in the year ending March 2019 (743 offences, compared with 740 in the previous year). There has been some fluctuation over the last few years, but the number of offences recorded in the latest year increased by 62% compared with the year ending March 2014.</p>
