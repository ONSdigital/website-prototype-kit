        <!-- Main content -->
        <article class="col col--md-36 col--lg-39">
          <h2>1. Main points</h2>
          <p>Overall levels of crime showed falls in recent decades, but levels have remained broadly stable in recent years. While in the last year there has been no change in overall levels of crime, this hides variation seen in individual crime types. The latest figures show a mixed picture, with continued rises in some types of theft and fraud and falls in computer misuse. Consistent with the rising trend over recent years, there were increases in some of the less frequently occurring but higher-harm types of violence, including offences involving knives and sharp instruments.</p>

          <h2>Headline figures</h2>
          <p>Over recent quarters, estimates from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) have indicated rises in theft. While the latest estimate showed no significant change in the last year, theft showed a 13% increase compared with the year ending March 2017. Despite this increase, estimates of theft remain much lower than 20 years ago.</p>
          <p>Police recorded crime figures give a reliable indication of trends in some types of offence involving theft that are thought to be well-reported and accurately recorded by the police. In the latest year these data show:<p>
            <ul>
              <li>a 2% increase in vehicle offences, which includes an 8% increase in the subcategory of “theft or unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle”</li>
              <li>an 11% increase in robbery</li>
              <li>a 3% decrease in burglaries, following rises seen in the previous two years</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The CSEW shows that the level of lower-harm violent offences (for example, violence without injury and assault with minor injury) did not change. However, police recorded crime gives more insight into the lower-volume but higher-harm violence that the survey either does not cover or does not capture well. These data show:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a 4% decrease in the number of homicides<sup> <a id ="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> following a period of increases over the last four years</li>
            <li>an 8% increase in the number of police recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments<sup> <a id ="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></li>
            <li>a 3% increase in the number of police recorded offences involving firearms</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Many of these lower-volume, higher-harm types of violence tend to be concentrated in metropolitan police force areas such as London, the West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester.</p>
          <p>The other changes seen in the main crime types measured by the CSEW were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a 17% increase in fraud offences</li>
            <li>a 21% decrease in computer misuse</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Latest figures</h2>
          <p>A summary of the latest figures for a selection of crime types is given in Table 1, using the most appropriate data source for each. More detailed analysis by crime type is provided in Sections 6 to 11.</p>

          <h2>3. Statistician's comment</h2>
          <p>Commenting on today’s figures, Mark Bangs from the Office for National Statistics Centre for Crime and Justice said:</p>

          <p>“The picture of crime is a complex one. Overall levels of crime have remained steady, but this is not the case for all types of crime. For example, overall levels of violence have remained steady but we have seen increases in violent crimes involving knives and sharp instruments. We have seen increases in fraud and overall theft, but decreases in burglary following recent rises.”</p>


          <h2><span class="section__content-number">4.</span> Things you need to know about this release</h2>

          <h3>How do we measure crime?</h3>
          <p>Crime covers a wide range of offences, from the most harmful such as murder and rape through to more minor incidents of criminal damage or petty theft. In general, the most serious crimes tend to be relatively low in volume and trends in total crime are often mainly influenced by changes in the levels of higher volume but less harmful crimes. Crime is often hidden and different types of offence occur in different circumstances and at different frequencies. This means crime can never be measured entirely by any single source.</p>

          <h3>Data sources included</h3>
          <p>This bulletin reports on two main sources of crime data: the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and police recorded crime. Where possible, we refer to other sources of data to support our findings.</p>

          <p>The CSEW is a face-to-face victimisation survey. People resident in households in England and Wales are asked about their experiences of a selected range of offences in the 12 months prior to the interview.</p>

          <p>Police recorded crime is the number of notifiable <sup><a id ="fnref:3" href="#fn:3" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> crimes reported to and recorded by the 44 police forces in England and Wales. For some types of crime, due to ongoing changes in police recording practices, an increase in the number of offences recorded by the police is unlikely to indicate a real rise in these types of crime.</p>

          <p>For an overview of general data quality and specific quality issues to be aware of for this release, see the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019#quality-and-methodology">Quality and methodology section</a>.</p>

          <p>Detailed information on the CSEW can be found in Section 2 of the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales">User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales</a>. Detailed information on police recorded crime can be found in Section 3.</p>

          <h4>Time periods covered</h4>
          <p>The latest CSEW figures presented in this release are based on interviews conducted between April 2018 and March 2019, measuring peoples’ experiences of crime in the 12 months before the interview.</p>

          <p>The latest recorded crime figures relate to crimes recorded by the police during the year ending March 2019 (April 2018 to March 2019). A “snapshot” of police recorded crime data for the year ending March 2019 was taken on 7 June 2019 to ensure the data do not change during the analysis period <sup><a id ="fnref:4" href="#fn:4" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>.</p>

          <h3>Other crime statistics and the wider criminal justice system</h3><p>In this bulletin we present the latest crime figures and trends. It provides a general overview, with more detailed discussion for certain types of crime where findings need a fuller explanation. If you are looking for a more in-depth analysis of specific types of offences, you may be interested in other articles and research that we produce throughout the year. To access these articles, see our <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice">main crime and justice webpage</a>.</p><p>The crime statistics reported in this release relate to only a part of the wider set of official statistics available on crime and other areas of the criminal justice system. This wider context includes statistics on: the outcomes of police investigations; the judicial process including charges, prosecutions and convictions; through to the management of prisons and prisoners.</p><p>Some of these statistics are published by the Home Office or the Ministry of Justice. We have produced a flowchart showing the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/overviewofcrimeandjusticestatistics">connections between the different aspects of crime and justice</a>, as well as the statistics available for each area.</p>
