          <p class="heading-medium">Three-year rise in homicides continues</p>
          <p>Latest police recorded figures show that there were 54 more homicides than the previous year, a 9% increase, to 653.</p>
          <div class="content-box highlight">
            <p>Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>
          </div>
          <p>This continues an upward trend seen in homicides since March 2014, indicating a change to the long-term fall seen in the previous decade.</p>
          <p>These figures exclude the London and Manchester terrorist attacks in 2017. They also exclude the 96 cases of manslaughter from the Hillsborough disaster which were recorded in 2016.</p>
          <div class="content-box highlight">
            <p>Although the deaths at Hillsborough occurred in 1989, an inquest returned a verdict of manslaughter and therefore was recorded as a homicide in the year 2016.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Homicides involving a knife or sharp instrument rose from 209 to 264, an increase of 26% in the last year.</p>


          <p class="heading-medium">The number of homicides per 1 million people has fallen 17% in the last decade</p>
          <p>The volume of homicides has generally decreased while the population has grown. </p>
          <p>The homicide rate fell 17% between the year ending March 2007 and the year ending December 2017, from 14 homicides per 1 million of the population to 12 homicides per 1 million, although small increases have been seen in the last two years.</p>
          <p>This contrasts with the trend seen from the early 1960s up to the early 2000s, when the number of homicides  grew faster than the population – from 300 per year to over 800 per year. </p>


          <p class="heading-medium">2% decrease in death or serious injury caused by unlawful driving</p>
          <p>In contrast with recent years, police recorded a 2% fall in this sub-category of homicide – 718 offences compared with 732 in the previous three months.</p>

                <p><strong>Homicide</strong><br />The term ‘homicide’ covers the offences of murder, manslaughter and infanticide.</p>
                <p><strong>Murder and manslaughter</strong><br />Murder and manslaughter are common law offences that have never been defined by statute, although they have been modified by statute. </p>
                <p><strong>Corporate manslaughter</strong><br />Where an organisation is deemed responsible for a person’s death. Created by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/19/contents">Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Infanticide</strong><br />Defined as the killing of a baby under one year old by their mother while the balance of her mind was disturbed as a result of giving birth. Created by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/1-2/36">Infanticide Act 1922</a> and refined by the Infanticide Act 1938 (section 1).</p>
                <p><strong>Death by driving offences</strong></br>
                Include death by dangerous driving, careless or inconsiderate driving, driving under the influence of drink or drugs and while being an unlicensed or uninsured driver.</p>

                <p>This page is part of our quarterly <a href="../collection">Crime Collection</a>, which relies on two main sources of data.</p>

                <p><strong>Crime Survey of England and Wales</strong></br>
                The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) is a survey which asks people whether they have been victims of a crime over the past 12 months.</p>

                <p><strong>Police recorded crime</strong></br>
                  Crime that has been reported to the police, and recorded as part of police casework.</p>
                  <div class="content-box highlight">
                    <p>Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>More information on both these sources can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales">User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales</a>.</p>
                  <p>More information on the methodology can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeinenglandandwalesqmi">Crime in England and Wales Quality and Methodology Information report</a>.</p>

              <div class="js-show-hide__content" style="overflow: auto;">
                <p><strong>Strengths and limitations of the data</strong></br>
                  The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) has been consistent since 1981 and is the best source to use when looking at trends over time. It is also a better measurement of crimes which are less likely to be reported to the police, such as sexual offences.</p>
                  <p>Police recorded crime is a good measure for understanding how much work police forces are carrying out. It can be affected by changes in policing practices and victims’ willingness to report crime. </p>
                  <div class="content-box highlight">
                    <p>Police recorded crime is not a useful way to monitor crime trends, and we do not recommend using it for this. Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>
                  </div>

                <p><strong>Time periods covered</strong></br>
                The Crime Survey for England and Wales data on this page are based on interviews conducted between January 2017 and December 2017, measuring peoples’ experiences of crime in the 12 months before the interview.</p>
                <p>The police recorded crime figures relate to crimes recorded by the police during the year ending December 2017 (between January 2017 and December 2017).</p>
                <p>“Latest year” (or “latest survey year”) refers to the (survey) year ending December 2017.</br>
                “Previous year” (or “previous survey year”) refers to the (survey) year ending December 2016.</p>

                <p><strong>Using the Home Office Homicide Index</strong></br>
                Home Office Homicide Index data will differ from the police recorded data used on this page.</p>
                <p>Police recorded crime data on homicide represent the recording decision of the police based on the available information at the time the offence comes to their attention. </p>
                <p>Homicide Index data take account of the charging decision and court outcome in cases that have gone to trial. It is not uncommon for offences initially recorded as murder by the police to be charged or convicted as manslaughter at court.</p>
