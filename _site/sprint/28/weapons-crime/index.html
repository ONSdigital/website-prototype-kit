              <p>London's Metropolitan Police saw the largest increase (accounting for 48% of the total increase).</p>
              <p>Admissions data for NHS hospitals in England shows a 7% increase in assault by a sharp object. Rising from 4,054 in the year ending March 2016 to 4,351 in the following 12 months.</p>

                  What do you need to know about these numbers?</p>

              <div class="js-show-hide__content" style="overflow: auto;">
                <p><strong>Strengths and limitations of the data</strong><br />The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) is a survey which asks people whether they have been victims of a crime over the past 12 months. The survey has been consistent since
                  1981 and therefore is the best source to use when looking at trends over time. It is also a better measurement of crimes which are less likely to be reported to the police, such as, sexual offences.</p>
                <p>Police recorded crime is crime that has been reported to the police, and recorded as part of police casework, making these figures sensitive to changes in policing practices and victims’ willingness to report crime. Therefore, an increase
                  in the number of crimes recorded by the police does not necessarily mean that crime itself has increased. While it is good for understanding how much work police forces are carrying out, it is not a useful way to monitor trends and we
                  do not recommend using it for exploring crime trends.</p>
                <p>Police recorded crime is a good measurement of:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Homicide</li>
                  <li>Firearm / gun crimes</li>
                  <li>Crimes involving a weapon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>
                <p><strong>Time periods covered</strong><br />The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales figures presented in this release are based on interviews conducted between January 2017 and December 2017, measuring peoples’ experiences of crime
                  in the 12 months before the interview.</p>
                <p>The latest recorded crime figures relate to crimes recorded by the police during the year ending December 2017 (between January 2017 and December 2017).</p>
                <p>In this release:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>“latest year” (or “latest survey year”) refers to the (survey) year ending December 2017</li>
                  <li>“previous year” (or “previous survey year”) refers to the (survey) year ending December 2016</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Increases in targeted police action in relation to knife crime could lead to more knife crimes being detected by Police Recorded Crime.</p>
                <p>It is likely that improvements in crime recording have affected some of the data in this bulletin. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>around one-third (32%) of the rise is due to an increase in possession of firearms offences with intent – these offences may have been recorded as simple possession offences previously, which are not covered by this data collection</li>
                  <li>around one-tenth (9%)of the increase is in offences involving some of the less serious weapons such as soft air weapons, BB guns, pepper spray and CS gas – it is likely that these are now included in police returns when previously they
                    were excluded.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>At time of publication, Greater Manchester Police were reviewing their knife crime figures, therefore data should be used with caution. Data will be updated following the review.</p>
