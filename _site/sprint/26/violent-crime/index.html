          <h2 id="section-1">Summary</h2>
          <p class="heading-small">The Crime Survey for England and Wales shows long-term reductions in violent crime but little change in recent years</p>
          <p>Around 2 in every 100 adults were a victim of CSEW violent crime in the latest survey year, compared with around 3 in 100 adults in the survey year ending March 2007 and 5 in 100 adults in 1995 (the peak year).</p>
          <p>However, in the year ending March 2017, the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) showed that more than half of violent crime victims (57%) did not report their experiences to the police. This is a return to levels seen preceding the year ending March 2013, following higher levels of reporting in the previous three years.</p>
          <p>Latest police recorded figures, excluding extraordinary events with multiple victims (like Hillsborough, and terrorist attacks), show that there were 54 more homicides than the previous year, a 9% increase to 653. This continues an upward trend seen in homicides since March 2014, indicating a change to the long-term downward trend seen in the previous decade.</p>
          <p>Although the deaths at Hillsborough occurred in 1989, an inquest returned a verdict of manslaughter and therefore was recorded as a homicide in the year 2016.</p>

              <p>Police recorded crime shows a continuing rises in a number of other violence crime offences – firearm offences and knife or sharp instrument offences.</p>
              <p>The overall number of offences involving a knife or sharp instrument has seen an increase in the last year, with increases in all offences included within the data collection. The data showed the highest number of offences involving knives or sharp instruments since 2011</p>
              <p>The police recorded 39,598 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument in the latest year ending December 2017, a 22% increase compared with the previous year (32,468) and the highest number in the seven-year series (from year ending March 2011), the earliest point for which comparable data are available.</p>
              <p>However, in the year ending March 2017, the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) showed that more than half of violent crime victims (57%) did not report their experiences to the police.

              <p class="heading-small">Long-term reductions in violent crime supported by other data</p>
              <p>The longer-term reductions in violent crime (as shown by the CSEW) are seen by recent <a href="http://digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB30098">admissions data for NHS hospitals in England</a>. Assault admissions for the year ending March 20172 (26,450) are 42% lower than the year ending March 2007 (45,890).</p>
              <p>Research conducted by the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/1162414/National-Violence-Surveillance-Network-Report-2017.pdf">Violence and Society Research Group at Cardiff University (PDF, 502KB)</a> shows similar findings. Results from their annual survey of a sample of hospital emergency departments and walk-in centres in England and Wales, show that serious violence-related attendances in 2017 have fallen 39% since 2010. However, similar to the latest CSEW findings, the latest data show little change in 2017 compared with 2016 (1% increase).</p>

                  <p><strong>Strengths and limitations of the data</strong><br />The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) is a survey which asks people whether they have been victims of a crime over the past 12 months. The survey has been consistent since 1981 and therefore is the best source to use when looking at trends over time. It is also a better measurement of crimes which are less likely to be reported to the police, such as, sexual offences.</p>
                  <p>Police recorded crime is crime that has been reported to the police, and recorded as part of police casework, making these figures sensitive to changes in policing practices and victims’ willingness to report crime. Therefore, an increase in the number of crimes recorded by the police does not necessarily mean that crime itself has increased. While it is good for understanding how much work police forces are carrying out, it is not a useful way to monitor trends and we do not recommend using it for exploring crime trends.</p>
                  <p>Police recorded crime is a good measurement of:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Homicide</li>
                    <li>Firearm / gun crimes</li>
                    <li>Crimes involving a weapon</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>
                  <p><strong>Time periods covered</strong><br />The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales figures presented in this release are based on interviews conducted between January 2017 and December 2017, measuring peoples’ experiences of crime in the 12 months before the interview.</p>
                  <p>The latest recorded crime figures relate to crimes recorded by the police during the year ending December 2017 (between January 2017 and December 2017).</p>
                  <p>In this release:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>“latest year” (or “latest survey year”) refers to the (survey) year ending December 2017</li>
                    <li>“previous year” (or “previous survey year”) refers to the (survey) year ending December 2016</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In the year ending March 2017, the CSEW showed that more than half of violent crime victims (57%) did not report their experiences to the police. This was a return to levels seen preceding the year ending March 2013, following higher levels of reporting in the previous three years. </p>
                  <p>In addition, police recorded crime statistics may be affected by changes in recording practices and police activity. While the CSEW gives us a good picture of the overall trend in violent crime, it is not good at measuring some types of violence.</p>
                  <p>In these cases, police recorded crime is a useful source as the better measure of the higher-harm but less common types of violence.</p>

                  <p>A comprehensive guide to crime types and definitions can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales#offence-types">ONS User Guide</a></p>

                  <p><strong>Violent crime</strong><br />Covers a range of offence types from minor assaults, such as pushing and shoving that result in no physical harm, to murder. This includes offences where the victim was intentionally stabbed, punched, kicked, pushed or jostled, as well as offences where the victim was threatened with violence whether or not there is any injury.</p>
                  <p>In published crime statistics, violent crime – both as measured by the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and by police recorded crime – is grouped into two broad, high-level categories: “violence with injury” and “violence without injury”.</p>
                  <p>However, these categories are not directly comparable between the CSEW and police recorded crime, and attempts to cause injury are categorised differently.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the two broad categories, police recorded crime statistics present a separate category for homicide – such offences are not covered by the CSEW as it is a victim-based survey.</p>
