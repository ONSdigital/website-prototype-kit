          <h2 id="main-findings" class="margin-top--7">Main findings for fraud</h2>
          <p class="heading-small">No increase in the amount of fraud</p>
          <p>3.2 million fraud offences were measured by the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). This has not increased from the results of last year’s survey.</p>

          <div class="content-box highlight">
            <p>Eiusmod excepteur veniam aute veniam ad eiusmod eiusmod anim labore laboris fugiat occaecat. Magna nisi esse sunt reprehenderit est laborum cillum velit deserunt.</p>
          </div>

          <p>The number of incidents referred to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) was also unchanged. The recorded crime series incorporates fraud offences collated by the NFIB from Action Fraud, Cifas, UK Finance and incidents referred to the police for investigation.</p>
          <div class="content-box highlight">
            <p>Eiusmod excepteur veniam aute veniam ad eiusmod eiusmod anim labore laboris fugiat occaecat. Magna nisi esse sunt reprehenderit est laborum cillum velit deserunt.</p>
          </div>

           <p>This series recorded a similar volume of fraud offences recorded in England and Wales in the year ending December 2017 (639,457 offences) compared with the previous year (639,476 offences).</p>

          <p class="heading-small">Drop in offences such as investment fraud or charity fraud</p>
          <p>The only category of fraud to show a significant change was “other fraud” (down 64%, from 97,000 to 35,000 offences).</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Statistically significant change at the 5% level is indicated by an asterisk.</li>
            <li>Non-investment fraud has been renamed as 'Consumer and retail fraud' to reflect the corresponding name change to the Home Office Counting Rules from April 2017.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="content-box highlight">
            <p>Eiusmod excepteur veniam aute veniam ad eiusmod eiusmod anim labore laboris fugiat occaecat. Magna nisi esse sunt reprehenderit est laborum cillum velit deserunt.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="heading-small">Small fall in banking and credit industry fraud, cheque, card and online bank account fraud</p>
          <p>Although there was no overall change, differences were shown in the number of offences recorded in the last year.</p>
          <p>Overall offences showed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cifas fell by 7% (down to 283,284 offences)</li>
            <li>UK Finance fell by 6% (down to 82,575 offences)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The falls reported by both Cifas and UK Finance were due largely to a volume decrease in “banking and credit industry fraud", with UK Finance showing a fall of 6% (to 82,575 offences), and Cifas showing a fall of 5% (to 244,968 offences).</p>
          <div class="content-box highlight">
            <p>Elit aliquip velit cupidatat cupidatat eu fugiat esse adipisicing esse fugiat proident commodo qui non reprehenderit deserunt.</p>
          </div>
          <p>This latest decrease reported by Cifas follows a period of increases seen in this type of fraud, and is driven largely by a decrease in “cheque, plastic card and online bank accounts fraud” (down 5% to 169,504 offences).</p>
          <p>Cifas also reported a 3% decrease in the latest year in the number of incidents of “application fraud” referred to NFIB. This includes opening up an account using fake or stolen documents in someone else’s name.</p>
          <div class="content-box highlight">
            <p>Eiusmod excepteur veniam aute veniam ad eiusmod eiusmod anim labore laboris fugiat occaecat. Magna nisi esse sunt reprehenderit est laborum cillum velit deserunt.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Again, this latest decrease in application fraud reported by Cifas follows previous large rises and is thought to reflect a return to normal levels after a spike in reporting in September 2016, as well as banks taking more preventative measures, in turn resulting in fewer fraudulent applications getting through the screening process.</p>

          <p class="heading-small">Rate of fraud in Southern England slightly higher than in Wales or northern England</p>
          <p>The latest police force area data show there was generally less variation in rates of fraud by police force area than for most other types of crime, although rates for force areas in southern England were generally a little higher than those among force areas in Wales or northern England.</p>

                  The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) is a survey which asks people whether they have been victims of a crime over the past 12 months.</li>

              <div class="js-show-hide__content" style="overflow: auto;">
                <p><strong>Strengths and limitations of the data</strong><br />The Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) is a survey which asks people whether they have been victims of a crime over the past 12 months. The survey has been consistent since 1981 and therefore is the best source to use when looking at trends over time. It is also a better measurement of crimes which are less likely to be reported to the police, such as, sexual offences.</p>
                <p>Police recorded crime is crime that has been reported to the police, and recorded as part of police casework, making these figures sensitive to changes in policing practices and victims’ willingness to report crime. Therefore, an increase in the number of crimes recorded by the police does not necessarily mean that crime itself has increased. While it is good for understanding how much work police forces are carrying out, it is not a useful way to monitor trends and we do not recommend using it for exploring crime trends.</p>
                <p>Police recorded crime is a good measurement of:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Homicide</li>
                  <li>Firearm / gun crimes</li>
                  <li>Crimes involving a weapon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>
                <p><strong>Time periods covered</strong><br />The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales figures presented in this release are based on interviews conducted between January 2017 and December 2017, measuring peoples’ experiences of crime in the 12 months before the interview.</p>
                <p>The latest recorded crime figures relate to crimes recorded by the police during the year ending December 2017 (between January 2017 and December 2017).</p>
                <p>In this release:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>“latest year” (or “latest survey year”) refers to the (survey) year ending December 2017</li>
                  <li>“previous year” (or “previous survey year”) refers to the (survey) year ending December 2016</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides the best indication of the volume of fraud offences directly experienced by people. CSEW estimates cover a wide range of fraud offences, including attempts and offences involving a loss, and include incidents not reported to the authorities. </p>
                <p>The number of incidents estimated by the CSEW is substantially higher than the number of incidents referred to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB), as the survey captures a large volume of lower-harm cases that are less likely to have been reported to the authorities.</p>
                <p>The CSEW suggests that less than one-fifth (17.3%) of incidents of fraud either come to the attention of the police or are reported by the victim to Action Fraud (Table E7, year ending March 2017).</p>
                <p>Action Fraud recorded lower than normal monthly volumes of fraud offences between July 2015 and April 2016, following the company contracted to provide the call centre service going into administration6. Volumes have recovered but because the lower-volume months form part of the comparator year (year ending December 2016), the latest figure will have been influenced by this issue, albeit to a lesser extent than seen previously.</p>

This covers a broad range of fraudulent activity, including dating scams (where the intended victim is befriended by a fraudster online and tricked into sending them money for a variety of emotive reasons), lottery scams (where the potential victim is told they have won a non-existent lottery prize and needs to pay a fee to release the winnings) and inheritance fraud (offering the false promise of an inheritance to trick victims into paying money or sharing bank or credit card details).</p>
                <p><strong>Other fraud</strong><br />Types of fraud where the number of offences are considered too small for measurement by the survey are covered by the “other fraud” category. This includes offences such as charity fraud, frauds by false representation and obtaining services dishonestly.</p>
                <p><strong>Banking and payment card frauds</strong><br />The most prevalent type of fraud, usually involving falsely obtaining or using personal bank or payment card details in order to carry out fraudulent transactions.</p>
                <p><strong>Computer misuse crime </strong><br />Covers any unauthorised access to computer material, as set out in the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (Annex 2 provides further information). This is not limited to desk or laptop computers and can include any device using operating software accessible online, for example, games consoles, smart phones and smart TVs. It includes offences such as the spread of viruses and other malicious software, hacking and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks (the flooding of internet servers to take down network infrastructure or websites).</p>

          <p>A correction has been made to the figure for increase in hospital admissions, in the first bullet point of the Main points and in Section 7: Some weapons offences are rising, but this type of crime remains rare.</p>
          <p>This was due to a small error when using the incorrect time series data point.</p>
          <p>We apologise for any inconvenience.</p>
